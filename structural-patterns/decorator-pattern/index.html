    <title>Decorator Pattern</title>
</head>
<body>
        The decorator pattern (also known as Wrapper, an alternative naming shared with the Adapter pattern) is a design pattern that allows the behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
        The Decorator pattern adds new behavior to objects dynamically at runtime wrapping itself around the original object. Multiple decorators can add or override functionality to the original object.
        Please see the code to understand in more detail.
        Here, the decorators are overriding the superclass .cost() method to return the current price of the MacBook plus with the cost of the upgrade being specified. It's considered a decoration as the original Macbook object's constructor methods which are not overridden (e.g. screenSize()) as well as any other properties which we may define as a part of the Macbook remain unchanged and intact.
